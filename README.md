Our project is a recreation of the card game "Freecell". We will do this with a
class hierarchy of card columns, foundations, and cascades. These will each
contain a cardStack class, which will have an ArrayList of the card class. With
methods contained in each of these, we will compare attributes of each card
to determine whether a move is legal or not, and move the card to another stack
if it is legal. When each foundation is built up with each card in its suit,
the game is won.
